       "Document(page_content='The Shortcut \\nAn infuential scientist in the feld of artifcial intelligence (AI) explains \\nits fundamental concepts and how it is changing culture and society. \\nA particular form of AI is now embedded in our tech, our infrastructure, \\nand our lives. How did it get there? Where and why should we be concerned? And what should we do now? The Shortcut: Why Intelligent Machines Do Not Think Like Us provides an accessible yet \\nprobing exposure of AI in its prevalent form today, proposing a new narrative to connect and make sense of events that have happened in the recent tumultuous past, and enabling us to think soberly about the road ahead. \\nThis book is divided into ten carefully crafted and easily digestible \\nchapters. Each chapter grapples with an important question for AI. Ranging from the scientifc concepts that underpin the technology to wider implications for society, it develops a unifed description using tools from diferent disciplines and avoiding unnecessary abstractions or words that end with -ism. The book uses real examples wherever possible, introducing the reader to the people who have created some of these technologies and to ideas shaping modern society that originate from the technical side of AI. It contains important practical advice about how we should approach AI in the future without promoting exaggerated hypes or fears. \\nEntertaining and disturbing but always thoughtful, The Shortcut \\nconfronts the hidden logic of AI while preserving a space for human dignity. It is essential reading for anyone with an interest in AI, the history of technology, and the history of ideas. General readers will come away much more informed about how AI really works today, and what we should do next.', metadata={'source': 'the_shortcut.pdf', 'page': 1})"

      "Nello Cristianini has been an infuential researcher in the feld \n",
      "of machine learning and AI for over 20 years. He is Professor \n",
      "of Artifcial Intelligence at the University of Bath, before that he has worked at the University of Bristol, the University of California (Davis), the University of London (Royal Holloway). For his work in machine learning, he has been a past recipient of the Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award, and of the ERC Advanced Grant. Cristianini has been the co-author of infuential books in machine learning, as well as dozens of academic articles, published in journals that range from AI to the philosophy of science, from the digital humanities to natural language processing, and from sociology to biology. In 2017, he delivered the annual STOA lecture at the European Parliament on the topic of the social impact of AI, a theme that he is still actively investigating. Cristianini has a degree in Physics from the University of Trieste, an MSc in Computational Intelligence from the University of London, and a PhD from the University of Bristol.\n",

      "At age fourteen, I spent a lot of time with my computer, which \n",
      "would not be strange except that this was 40 years ago, in a small town in Italy. At school, I had to study Latin and Greek, and that winter I was having trouble with Greek grammar, so my mother organised for an old priest of the nearby convent to give me some extra tutoring. Don Antonio was about 80 years old, and I  could not understand all that he said, but at least I could walk there on my own. \n",
      "One day, he asked me why I had not fnished my work and so \n",
      "I had to tell him about the computer. He immediately wanted to see it, as he had read so much about computers in the news-papers, so the next day he walked to my home. It took a while. When he saw my little Sinclair ZX80, he looked a bit disap-pointed, probably because it was so small. I turned on the big black and white TV that I used as a monitor, and after the usual fve minutes of warming up, we started seeing the faint image of the prompt.\n",

      "“Ask it when Alexander the Great was born”. \n",
      "I objected that the computer would not know how to answer, \n",
      "but he strongly insisted that I should at least try. I was not going to argue with him, so I just typed the question, in Italian where commands in Basic language were expected, and I obtained the only possible answer: SYNTAX ERROR. \n",
      "Don Antonio started making his impatient expression, which \n",
      "I knew all too well, so I told him, “If you let me do some prepa-ration, I can program it to answer this question”, and he went to speak with my mother. \n",
      "A few minutes later I called him, and this time, after typing \n",
      "the question, the computer printed on the screen the answer, “356 BC”. This annoyed him even more. “Of course it knows it now, you just told it the answer”. \n",
      "I explained to him that computers do not know anything on \n",
      "their own, we need to tell them everything, but then they can remember it and maybe reason about it. But by then he had turned his back on the machine and added, \n",
      "“This thing will never be better than us”. He sounded a bit relieved, as well as disappointed. Was he right, though? Had we just established that our cre-\n",
      "ations shall always be inferior to us? He certainly did get me thinking for quite some time. \n",
      "It must have been the summer of 2012, 30 years later, when \n",
      "my children and their cousins were playing with an iPhone on the beach, not far from the same town where the old priest saw my new computer. They showed me Siri, which I had read about but had never seen, and invited me to ask it any question. \n",
      "“When was Alexander the Great born?” The question came \n",

      "INTELLIGENCE \n",
      "Intelligence is not about being human, but about being able to \n",
      "behave efectively in new situations. This ability does not require a brain: we can fnd it also in plants, ant colonies and software. Diferent agents can display this ability to diferent extents in diferent tasks: there is not a single general way to be intelligent, nor a secret formula or a single test. It is misleading to attribute human qualities to all intelligent agents, and when refecting on the intelligences we encounter in our browsers we would do bet-ter by comparing them with the snails and herbs in our garden, rather than with us. \n",
      "In 1972 and 1973, NASA launched two Pioneer spacecraft \n",
      "destined to ultimately leave the solar system. Along with their instruments, they also carried a “message from mankind” to any form of alien intelligence that might stumble upon them, \n",

      "with a drawing of two human beings, a map of the solar sys-tem, and the diagram of an atom of hydrogen, as well as other symbols such as a map of 14 pulsars. The idea behind the mes-sage was that it should enable an alien intelligence to identify its origin and authors, though to this day we are still to receive any response. \n",
      "A few years later, Sagan—a long-time advocate of the search \n",
      "for extraterrestrial intelligence—gave a lecture at the Royal Insti-tution in London, where he presented his newest efort on the same subject. This did not require aliens physically approaching an artefact from Earth, but just receiving a radio signal: a par -\n",
      "ticular sequence of 31\n",
      "3 bits that—once folded into a 31×31×31 \n",
      "cube—represents a stylised image of a formaldehyde molecule. This in turn would suggest to aliens that they should start listen-ing on the radio frequency specifc to that molecule.

The idea of purpose-driven (or purposeful) behaviour is the cornerstone of cybernetics, an early science of intelligent agents. For example, in the game of chess, the environment is represented both by the rules and by the opponent, who responds to the agent’s moves, and the purpose of the agent is to win a match by forcing a checkmate. In evo-lutionary biology, it is assumed that the ultimate goal of any organism is the survival of its genes. \n",

Also, social media had already been used before in US campaigning. As for psychographic segmentation, that was known to scientists too; two research papers, written before the 2016 campaign, explained how to infer personality information based on social media behaviour, and how to exploit the resulting information to improve “mass persuasion”.\n",

The remarkable answer was that this information, one of the key ingredients mentioned by Alexander Nix, can indeed be inferred from our online pub-lic behaviour, as we will see below.

Then they waited. This is called an a/b test and is designed much like a clinical trial so that each group is identical to the others, except for one variable: the shade of blue.

That year, the overall view time of the platform increased by 50%.

Even if many machine deci-sions are not explainable today, and even if the code has been released online, we should demand that a recommender engine declares its reward function publicly and plainly, as well as the signals it uses. Users should not have to wonder if a certain con-versation or their location might be used as part of persuasive eforts, they should clearly know it from the start and openly have consented to it.

The “high-risk” category would come with many obligations of oversight and transparency and include any applications of AI that could result in loss of life (e.g. mass transport), access to education, employment, credit (sorting CVs, scoring exams, assessing loan applications), law enforcement, and judicial situations. It is not clear, however, how these would actually work in practice; would a CV-screening soft-ware need to be trained on hand-made high-quality data? Would data from the wild still be allowed?
